\usage{
get.performance.measures(outcome, prob, threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{a vector of the outcome labels.}

\item{prob}{a numeric vector of the predicted probability.}

\item{threshold}{a numeric threshold for the predicted probability. A predicted probability of above a threshold is considered a positive prediction.}
